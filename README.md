# Python Essential Training – Practice Repository

This repository contains my hands-on practice, exercises, and notes while following the [Python Essential Training – LinkedIn Learning](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/python-essential-training-18764650) course.

The goal of this repo is learning and practicing.

**File naming convention:** SS_VV-topic.ipynb where *SS* is the course section number (e.g. 02 = Quickstart) and *VV* is the video order within that section.
